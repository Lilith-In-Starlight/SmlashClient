# SmlashClient
Smlash is the esplort of the ages, in which the rules that dictate how the universe itself works will always lie on the strongest hands.

Smlash is, in the sense of traditional competitive games, a party game, since a lot of the things that happen in it actually exist to hinder more skilled players, or are playable RNG. Howerver, in a esplort sense of the word, it is entirely a competitive game, since an esplort is characterized by those elements.
